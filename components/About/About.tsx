        Hi, I'm Nana Kofi Okae, a software engineering student at Virginia
        Commonwealth University (VCU), graduating in December 2024. I've been
        building projects for four yearsâ€”from creating my professors website to
        developing my senior capstone project, and many more, which can be found
        on my GitHub.
